# Better display "featured section" at OpenSea

This script aims to improve the display of text in the "featured-section-description" section on the OpenSea platform. It mainly concerns the display of new lines and tabulation.

In the screenshots below, you can see how OpenSea displays the text and how readability improves after enabling the script in Tampermonkey.
